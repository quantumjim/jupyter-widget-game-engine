# Making your first quantum game

To start learning [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), you could try making a simple game. For that you need a simple game engine, like the one provided in the [Qiskit textbook](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-textbook/blob/master/README.md).

See the notebooks below for more information.

* [How to use the game engine](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/jupyter-widget-game-engine/blob/master/jupyter_widget_game.ipynb)

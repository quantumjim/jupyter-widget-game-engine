    "For this to work, you'll need the file [jupyter_widget_engine.py](jupyter_widget_engine.py) to be located somewhere importable. Having it sit in the same folder as your notebook is the easiest way. If you are using the IBM Quantum Experience, using the 'Import' button on [this page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter) to upload the file.\n",

    "## The game engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The game engine gives us the ability to make games for a low-pixel screen (8x8 by default), controlled by a D-pad and five buttons. Note that the screen will only update when a button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game engine is all based around a class. You can call this whaetever you like. In the following we will call it `engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The screen\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixels can be addressed in the functions using `engine.screen`. The pixel at position (x,y) is adressed as `engine.screen[x,y]`. The Jupyter widget used for each pixel is a deactived (i.e. unpressable) button object, and can be manipulated accordingly. The two attributes that you are recommended to use are `button_style`, `value` and `description`. The `button_style` attribute sets the colour by assigning it one of the following strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For grey use `''`.\n",
    "* For green use `'success'`.\n",
    "* For blue use `'info'`.\n",
    "* For orange use `'warning'`.\n",
    "* For red use `'danger'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `value` attribute allows you to set light and dark states. For dark use `True` and for light use `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `description` attribute allows you to set text. Note that most pixels won't contain more than a few characters. A larger piece of text can be written on the long pixel at the bottom of the screen, which is accessed with `engine.screen['text']`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The controller\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller is accessed using `engine.controller`. Its buttons are addressed using the keys `'down'`, `'up'`, `'left'`, `'right'`, `'A'`, `'B'`, `'X'`, `'Y'` and `'next'`. Each is a Jupyter widget button object. Pressing any of these buttons will cause the `next_frame` function to run. Use the `value` attribute of each button to determine whether the button has been pressed (`True`) or not (`False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The game loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Games are made by defining two functions, `start` and `next_frame`. The `start` function runs when the game begins, and `next_frame` runs every time a button is pressed to move the game along. Both should have a single argument: the class `engine`. All parameters required for the game should be defined as attributes to the `engine` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is started by initiating the `jupyter_widget_engine` object with the `start` and `next_frame` functions. You can also choose a size other than the default 8x8 grid using the kwarg `L`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter_widget_engine(start,next_frame,L=8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the grid size can be accessed in the `start` and `next_frame` functions as `engine.L`.\n",
